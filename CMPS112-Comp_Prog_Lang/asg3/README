This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Tim Mertogul (tmertogu@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Sean McGrath (ssmcgrat@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individuals effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Tim Mertogul spent 4 hours working alone
Sean McGrath spent 3 hours working alone
We spent 32 hours working together
Sean McGrath spent 16 hours driving
Tim Mertogul spent 16 hours driving
