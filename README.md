# UCSC-coursework

This repository contains work I completed in several different classes while attending UCSC. The repository is divided into files specific to each individual course. All projects contain all necessary files to run properly, and wherever possible include a pdf of the assignment specifications and test input. Also, one professor sent out an in-depth narrative evaluation of my performance in three of his classes, which can all be found under their respective courses (cmps12b, cmps109, and cmps112).
