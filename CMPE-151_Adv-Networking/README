This project was my independent lab for CMPE 151, Advanced Networks in Spring 2015.
The goal of the project was for each student to explore a newtorking technology not covered in the course
and develop a lab assignment about that technology which a future class could possibly study. 

Having been introduced to the concept of Network Address Translation (NAT) in CMPE 150, I decided to further 
explore this technology and study Double NAT. My goal was to learn what potential problems a double NAT 
architecture could impose within a private network, and how such a network configuration could be set up.
The lab was done using a virtual machine and used Oracle's VirtualBox. All virtual routers were Cisco routers 
and the client machines were Linux PCs. 

For an overview of Double NAT and my findings, see this presentation which I gave to the class on the final
day of instruction. It overviews the concept and takes the reader through a step by step process of my lab, 
including my conclusions.
